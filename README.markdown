# SoundCleod OBS Edition

This is a fork of [SoundCleod](https://soundcleod.com) originally created by Márton Salomváry. The only purpose of this fork is to integrate with [OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com/).

Compared to using SoundCloud.com in a web browser like Chrome or Firefox you
will get the following extras when using SoundCleod:

- Dark mode
- Desktop notifications
- Control playback using media keys on the keyboard (▶ ❚❚ and friends)
- True full screen without browser buttons
- Control playback from the Notification Center using the Now Playing widget on macOS
- Control playback from the macOS application menu
- Stop playback when your computer goes to sleep
- Close or hide all windows without interrupting playback

SoundCleod is a weird name. [How to pronounce it?](https://soundcloud.com/senart/soundcleod)
