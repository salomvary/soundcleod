## What is SoundCleod?

SoundCleod is a desktop application which brings
[SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) to macOS and Windows without using a web
browser.

Compared to using SoundCloud.com in a web browser like Chrome or Firefox you
will get the following extras when using SoundCleod:

- Dark mode
- Desktop notifications
- Control playback using media keys on the keyboard (▶ ❚❚ and friends)
- True full screen without browser buttons
- Control playback from the Notification Center using the Now Playing widget on macOS
- Control playback from the macOS application menu
- Stop playback when your computer goes to sleep
- Close or hide all windows without interrupting playback
