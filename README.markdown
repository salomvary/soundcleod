## This project is NO LONGER MAINTAINED, do not use it!

8 years, 11 months, 11 days after the [first
commit](https://github.com/salomvary/soundcleod/commit/63c11038cace325d07d25191b01e744ba09a5b19)
I realized I've lost interest, motivation and time for maintaining SoundCleod
and decided to retire the project. The GitHub repository is read-only from now,
the soundcleod.com domain will continue working until it expires on 2022-05-05.

It is strongly recommended to uninstall SoundCleod to prevent future security
issues, for which no fixes will be released.

For those seeking alternatives I recommend switching to the official
[SoundCloud Desktop Player](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803560930-Desktop-Player)
or using any modern web browser.

## What is SoundCleod?

SoundCleod is a desktop application which brings
[SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com) to macOS and Windows without using a web
browser.

Compared to using SoundCloud.com in a web browser like Chrome or Firefox you
will get the following extras when using SoundCleod:

- Dark mode
- Desktop notifications
- Control playback using media keys on the keyboard (▶ ❚❚ and friends)
- True full screen without browser buttons
- Control playback from the Notification Center using the Now Playing widget on macOS
- Control playback from the macOS application menu
- Stop playback when your computer goes to sleep
- Close or hide all windows without interrupting playback

SoundCleod is a weird name. [How to pronounce it?](https://soundcloud.com/senart/soundcleod)
